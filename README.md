# Preparing Statistician to be Successful Big Data Scientist

Outline/Description: With recent big data revolution, enterprises ranging from FORTUNE 500 to startups across the US are hungry for data scientists to bring valuable business insight from all the data collected. Statisticians are great data scientist candidates, but there are relatively few data scientists with statistics education background. In this short course, we will walk through the needed data science knowledge and skills (such as deep learning and big data platform) through hands-on exercises to prepare statisticians to be successful data scientists. Data science is a combination of science and art with data as the foundation. We will also cover the art part to guide participants to learn typical data science project flow, general pitfalls in data science projects, and soft skills to communicate with business stakeholders effectively. The Databricks community edition cloud platform and R-Studio will be used to cover programming and platform (such as Spark, Hadoop, GPU, SQL, and R) and conventional machine learning algorithms (including examples for unsupervised learning and deep learning). The prerequisite knowledge is MS level education in statistics and entry level of R knowledge.

1. Introduction to data science. In this section, we will give an introduction to data science. Participants will have a good understanding of what data scientists do and know their skill and knowledge gaps after taking this section.

2. Deep Learning Lecture. In this section, we will briefly introduce the history of deep learning and the essential concepts that we need to know for deep learning applications. Then we will introduce the feed forward neural network (FFNN) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the MNIST handwritten digits examples. The R package keras will be used to show how to build FFNN and CNN models.

3. Data Preprocessing Using R Pipe Line. For R users not familiar with the R pipeline way of written code, we have this brief introduction section of using R pipeline which will be used in most of the hands-on session.

4. Databricks account setup. In this section, we will walk through the steps to apply and setup a Databricks Community Edition free account and all the hands-on sessions will run in this account.

5. Deep Learning Hands On. In this section, we will walk through all the steps to (1) create a cloud computing node, (2) create a notebook using R, (3) import a notebook of deep learning applications with FFNN and CNN, (4) step-by-step illustration of FFNN model, (5) step-by-step illustration of CNN model.

6. Data Preprocessing & Wrangling. In this section, we will walk through major steps in data preprocessing and wrangling.

7. Big Data Cloud Platform. In this section, we will introduce the big data cloud platform and steps to use R to directly interact with Spark dataframes for big data applications.

8. Data Preprocessing & Wrangling Hands On. In this section, we will use Databricks community edition to walk through the steps.

9. Big Data Cloud Platform Hands On. In this section, we will use Databricks community edition to walk through the steps.

10. Soft Skills and Data Science Project Cycle. In this section, we will introduce the needed soft skills that are essential in data science projects at enterprise environments. We will talk about basic project management skills with agile concepts and how to effectively communicate with business partners to define and solve data science problems. We will illustrate how to lead with confidence given the strong technical background that statisticians have.

11. Analytical dashboard and report. In this section, we will introduce how to build reproducible dashboard and report using rmarkdown and deploy it.
